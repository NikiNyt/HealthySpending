🥗 HealthySpending

**Track healthiness. Find deals. Eat better.**

HealthySpending is an open-source platform designed to help people track the nutritional value of their food and locate high-quality, healthy options at affordable prices (or even free!). We believe healthy eating should be accessible to everyone, regardless of budget.
